Auxiliary Channel Analysis Code for GW Data

This repository contains some preliminary codes for analyzing auxiliary channel data of gravitational wave detectors. 
The project is very highly experimental but could be useful for the future operation, maintaining the classifying glitch noises.
Mainly the codes analyzes the correlation between channels via PearsonR and Mutual Information Coefficient.
The pipelined main code is just a 'CorrMatrxPipe.py', which is still under development. If you want to use this, please enter:
